Only a single chat room/channel to start
only one page is necessary (SPA)

User should
-See all messages
-create new messages

when opening site for the first time:
-allow user option to:
--login
--create user account
----choose a unique username
----choose a 4-digit password
--view as a guest


TCP connection to communicate between the server and database
Best approach for this:
-use driver/library/dependency
--for NodeJs: node-postgres library
--for C#: npgsql NuGet Package


The user-interface needs:
-main chat cscreen
-input box
-send buttons
-users sidebar (who else is there)
-"dummy Data" 

Expected functionality:
-user can post a message. Message is lost upon refresh

App is using a front-end framework (react)
